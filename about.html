                    Yes, that's a cartoon. No, I don't actually look that put-together before my third cup of coffee.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've spent the better part of two decades convincing computers to do things they really
                    didn't want to do. Mostly in Linux, where the documentation is "read the source code" and
                    the error messages are written by people who assume you already know what went wrong.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At Forescout, I architect cybersecurity solutions focused on one core problem: figuring
                    out what's actually connected to your network. I design and deploy systems that discover
                    every device, classify what it is, determine if it belongs there, and remove it if it
                    doesn't. The work covers pre-sales architecture, implementation, and troubleshooting.
                    I also handle integrating Forescout with whatever other security tools are already in
                    place. Most organizations are surprised by what's actually on their networks. And a lot
                    of it has no business being there.

                <h3>Patents</h3>
                <p>
                    I hold two U.S. patents, which sounds impressive until you realize they're about
                    making embedded devices fail gracefully. Turns out, teaching hardware to recover from
                    its own mistakes is a patentable innovation. Who knew.

                <h3>The Technical Bits</h3>
                <p>
                    My background spans embedded systems, firmware development, and cybersecurity architecture.
                    I've written code that runs on devices with less memory than this webpage consumes, and
                    I've architected security solutions for networks with more endpoints than some countries have people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Linux is my natural habitat. I've compiled kernels for fun, debugged driver issues at 2 AM
                    for less fun, and have strong opinions about init systems that I'll share whether you ask or not.

                <h3>Current Obsession</h3>
                <p>
                    These days, I'm exploring how AI can augment software development without producing
                    the kind of code that makes future maintainers question your life choices. Hence this
                    portfolio, where every commit is labeled so you can see exactly who (or what) is
                    responsible for each brilliant decision and inevitable bug.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The verdict so far: AI is a surprisingly capable pair programmer, provided you actually
                    pay attention. If you don't, you'll get code that technically works but spiritually
                    shouldn't exist.
