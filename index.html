                        Twenty-plus years in the industry, and I've spent most of it convincing computers to do
                        things they really didn't want to do. Started in embedded systems and firmware development,
                        writing code for devices with less memory than this webpage consumes. Somewhere along the
                        way I picked up two U.S. patents for teaching hardware to recover from its own mistakes. Turns
                        out, that's a patentable innovation.

                    <p>
                        At Forescout, I architect solutions for the fundamental problem everyone ignores until
                        it's too late: figuring out what's actually connected to your network. I design and deploy
                        systems that discover every device, classify what it is, determine if it belongs there,
                        and remove it if it doesn't. Most organizations are surprised by what's actually on their
                        networks. A lot of it has no business being there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before that, I did stints at Haystax (insider threat detection via machine learning, monitoring
                        2+ million individuals for anomalous behavior), Arxan Technologies (application shielding and
                        mobile security), and CyberMDX (medical device security, because apparently CT scanners running
                        Windows XP is a thing we tolerate). I've presented at HIMSS on threat detection in unmanaged
                        medical devices, and at GITEX Global on network access control. Partner enablement, channel
                        training, strategic account management. Conference booth veteran. I've worn the polo, worked
                        the badge scanner, and smiled through more "what does your company do" conversations than
                        any human should endure. Still, there's nothing quite like watching a prospect realize you
                        just saved them six months of pain.

                        At Broadcom, I was the sole software support resource for the Central US and Brazil.
                        Thirteen accounts, $300 million in recurring revenue, one phone number. XGS/Robo SDK
                        support, executive relationships, and first point of contact when everything caught fire.

                    <p>
                        Before that, Dell. Enterprise networking OS development. BSPs for campus switches, board
                        architecture input, FPGA specs. Built the Linux prototyping environment because waiting
                        for official toolchains is how projects die.

                        This is where I cut my teeth. At SmartSynch, I developed firmware for cellular-enabled Smart
                        Meter devices on ARM7/ARM9 processors with Nucleus RTOS. Built custom Linux BSPs, maintained
                        the source code repository for all active development, and created the disaster recovery
                        procedure that could restore units to factory defaults in the field without human interaction.
                        That last one became a patent.

                    <p>
                        At Control4, I worked on home automation systems targeting the $500K–$1M home market.
                        Designed and implemented SIP-based video intercom endpoints, integrated board support
                        packages into build systems supporting dozens of cross-compilers and target devices.

                    These days, I'm exploring how AI can augment software development without producing
                    the kind of code that makes future maintainers question your life choices. Hence this
                    portfolio, where every commit is labeled so you can see exactly who (or what) is
                    responsible for each brilliant decision and inevitable bug.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The verdict so far: AI is a surprisingly capable pair programmer, provided you actually
                    pay attention. If you don't, you'll get code that technically works but spiritually
                    shouldn't exist.
